# Mission-Mapping-Program-Challenge-1
The First Mission Mapping Program Challenge!

                1st Project: (This program will be simple, and will start with just text. Shortly after that, we will move on to the next building block.)
                
o   The program will allow a user to enter 3 data types. (Point, Line, Circle) [Extra Credit for defined shapes other than a circle.]
o   Points must be able to save a name and coordinate location. Any formatting (as long as it is consistent) is fine.
o   Lines must be able to save a name, start point, mid-point, and end-point. [Extra Credit for allowing more than one mid-point.]
o   Circles must be able to save a name, starting coordinates, and radius.
o   The program will save any of the data types entered to memory.
o   The program will allow for any reasonable number of entered points, lines, or circles.
o   When asked, the program will display a list of all saved Points, Lines, or Circles.
o   THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE TEXT ONLY. Save the points, lines, and circles to objects or an array, and display them when asked. If you can make a GUI for this, then that is awesome, but not required.

 

Extra Credit
o   A User should be able to delete a point, line, or circle by referencing its unique name.
o   A user should be able to edit a point, line, or circle by referencing its unique name.
o   The program should be able to export a list of saved Points, Lines, or Circles to a text file.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
