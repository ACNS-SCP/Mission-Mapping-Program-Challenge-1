# Mission-Mapping-Program-Challenge-1
The First Mission Mapping Program Challenge!

✔   The program will allow a user to enter 3 data types. (Point, Line, Circle) [Extra Credit for defined shapes other than a circle.]
✔   Points must be able to save a name and coordinate location. Any formatting (as long as it is consistent) is fine.
✔   Lines must be able to save a name, start point, mid-point, and end-point. [Extra Credit for allowing more than one mid-point.]
✔   Circles must be able to save a name, starting coordinates, and radius.
✔   The program will save any of the data types entered to memory.
✔   The program will allow for any reasonable number of entered points, lines, or circles.
✔¹   When asked, the program will display a list of all saved Points, Lines, or Circles.
✔²   THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE TEXT ONLY. Save the points, lines, and circles to objects or an array, and display them when asked. If you can make a GUI for this, then that is awesome, but not required.

 

Extra Credit

✔   A User should be able to delete a point, line, or circle by referencing its unique name.
o   A user should be able to edit a point, line, or circle by referencing its unique name.
✔   The program should be able to export a list of saved Points, Lines, or Circles to a text file.

1) Program displays all points, lines and circles as soon as they are added.
2) GUI interface, easier to manage vs tiered menu items and easier to see the data as a whole.
